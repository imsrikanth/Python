# Comparison Operators
```==, !=, >, <, >=, <=```   

Comparison operators are used to comparing the value of the two operands and returns Boolean true or false accordingly.

### Greater than (>)
Returns True if the left operand is greater than the right
x > y

### Less than (<)
Returns True if the left operand is less than the right
x < y

### Equal to (==)
Returns True if both operands are equal
x == y

### Not equal to (!=)
Returns True if operands are not equal
x != y

### Greater than or equal to (>=)
Returns True if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right
x >= y

### Less than or equal to (<=)
Retuns True if the left operand is less than or equal to the right
x <= y

### Examples
```python
# Examples of Relational Operators
a = 13
b = 33

# a > b is False
print(a > b)

# a < b is True
print(a < b)

# a == b is False
print(a == b)

# a != b is True
print(a != b)

# a >= b is False
print(a >= b)

# a <= b is True
print(a <= b)
```
