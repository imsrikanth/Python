# Arithmetic Operators
``` +, -, *, /, //, %, ** ```

Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations

### Addition (+)
Addition: adds two operands
x + y

### Subtraction (-)
Subtraction: subtracts two operands
x - y

### Multiplication (*)
Multiplication: multiplies two operands
x * y

### Division  (/)
Division (float): divides the first operand by the second
x / y

### Floor Division (//) 
Division (floor): divides the first operand by the second
x // y

### Modulus  (%)
Modulus: returns the remainder when the first operand is divided by the second
x % y

### Power  (**)
Power: Returns first raised to power second
x ** y

### Examples:
```python
# Examples of Arithmetic Operator
a = 9
b = 4

# Addition of numbers
add = a + b

# Subtraction of numbers
sub = a - b

# Multiplication of number
mul = a * b

# Division(float) of number
div1 = a / b

# Division(floor) of number
div2 = a // b

# Modulo of both number
mod = a % b

# Power
p = a ** b

# print results
print(add)
print(sub)
print(mul)
print(div1)
print(div2)
print(mod)
print(p)
```
